// 	<p>Losing weight can be hard. For years I struggled with my weight. I tried vegan diets, carnivore diets, no-carb diets, slow-carb diets, and of course, my favorite, the KETOGENIC diet!<br/><br/>
// 	Little did I know that losing weight is easy and that you can do it while eating whatever you want! You don't have to give up your favorite foods! Carbs are NOT the enemy. And yes, you can even have a drink or 2 every night.<br/><br/>
